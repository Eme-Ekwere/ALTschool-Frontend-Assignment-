            <h2>My Reason and Goals for Joining ALT_SCHOOL</h2>
          </header>
          <article>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
            <p>
              I joined ALT_SCHOOL School of Engineering to pursue the Cloud
              Engineering course. Initially, it was mere curiosity that drew me
              in. However, I quickly realized that there was a significant gap
              in the field that needed to be filled. This realization prompted
              me to take the initiative to train and develop the necessary
              skills to address this gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              After extensive research into cloud engineering, my curiosity
              evolved into a deep-seated desire to learn and excel in this area.
              Nigeria is on the cusp of a massive technological breakthrough,
              with even the smallest businesses moving online and targeting
              foreign markets. There is a pressing need for indigenous cloud
              engineers who understand and can navigate the economic climate of
              our country and continent, and who are dedicated to helping
              startups, organizations, businesses, and even the government scale
              and grow with secure and well-designed cloud infrastructures.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to become one of those engineers, contributing to the
              growth and success of businesses in Nigeria and beyond.
            </p>

          <article>
            <h3 id="end">My Goals</h3>
            <p>
              My primary goal is to acquire advanced technical skills that will
              enable me to contribute effectively to software development
              projects. I aim to learn the latest technologies, frameworks, and
              methodologies used in the industry to stay ahead of the curve and
              be well-prepared for future challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I hope to network with like-minded individuals and
              professionals, collaborate on innovative projects, and gain
              practical experience through hands-on learning opportunities.
              These experiences will not only enrich my knowledge but also help
              me build a robust professional portfolio.
