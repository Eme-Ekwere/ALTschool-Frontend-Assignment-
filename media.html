          <h2>An Excerpt from My Life's Journey</h2>
          <p>
            For the longest time, I battled with depression and a sense of low
            self-worth. I always saw myself through the lens of another's growth
            and progress. This robbed me of confidence and drive. I stopped
            aspiring for better because I couldn't see myself as good enough. I
            lost faith in my ability for greatness.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a world where social media highlights the best moments of
            everyone’s life, it’s easy to fall into the trap of comparison. I
            saw curated snapshots of success, happiness, and perfection, and
            often felt inadequate or behind. However, this mindset was very
            detrimental to my mental well-being and personal growth. I had to
            relearn this crucial fact: my biggest competition should be myself,
            not others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparing yourself to others is like comparing apples to oranges.
            Everyone’s path is different, shaped by unique experiences,
            challenges, and opportunities. When you measure your progress
            against someone else’s achievements, you’re not giving yourself a
            fair chance. The most dangerous fact about comparison is that it
            distracts you from your goals.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Prioritizing Your Growth is Healthy</h3>
          <p>
            The only person you should strive to be better than is the person
            you were yesterday. By focusing on self-improvement, you can achieve
            personal growth and fulfillment. Here’s why competing with yourself
            is the healthiest and most productive mindset:
          </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Personalized Progress:</strong> When you focus on your
                journey, you set goals that are meaningful and tailored to your
                strengths and interests. This personalized approach ensures that
                you’re growing in ways that matter to you.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Celebrating Small Wins:</strong> Every step forward, no
                matter how small, is a victory. By recognizing and celebrating
                your progress, you build confidence and motivation to keep
                going.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Learning from Setbacks:</strong> Competing with yourself
                allows you to view setbacks as learning opportunities. You
                become more resilient and adaptable, turning challenges into
                valuable experiences.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Authentic Success:</strong> Success looks different for
                everyone. By defining your own standards and measuring success
                on your terms, you achieve authentic fulfillment and happiness.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Draw Inspiration and Wisdom</h3>
          <p>
            While it’s important not to compare yourself to others, it doesn’t
            mean you can’t draw inspiration from them. Learning from the stories
            and experiences of others can provide valuable insights and
            motivation.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Seek Mentors, Not Idols:</strong> Find mentors who can
                guide and support you. Learn from their experiences without
                trying to replicate their journey exactly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Adapt, Don’t Adopt:</strong> Take what resonates with
                you from others’ stories and adapt it to fit your unique path.
                What works for someone else might need tweaking to work for you.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Focus on Principles, Not Outcomes:</strong> Instead of
                fixating on the end results, focus on the principles and habits
                that led to others’ success. These can often be adapted to your
                circumstances.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Remember, no two people are the same, and the measure of success is
            subjective. Your journey is unique, and your competition is
            yourself. Strive to be better than you were yesterday, drawing
            inspiration and wisdom from others, but always keeping in mind that
            your path is your own. As we go along on this journey with
            AltSchool, remember your why—this is for you.
